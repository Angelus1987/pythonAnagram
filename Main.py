        An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, 
        typically using all the original letters exactly once. It can however us on a few of the letters.    
        A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same 
        backward as forward, such as "madam" or "racecar".

        A palingram – a letter palingram. A palingram can also be created using syllables
        or words, in addition to individual letters. An example of this using words is, “He was, was he?” 
        Notice that the words can be reversed and the sentence still reads the same. 
        A sentence that is a palingram and a palindrome is, “I did, did I”  

        This application allows three activities.

          Activity A: Finds the anagrams for any word you enter. Then identifies palindromes, if there are any, 
                      in the identified anagrams. 

          Activity B: Finds all the word pairs in the dictionary list which form palingrams. 
                      The palingrams ignore spaces and hyphens.   

          Activity C: Find all the palindromes in the dictionary.
